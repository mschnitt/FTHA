                        conveniently established along waterways and supplied cheaply
                        by contract steamboats, were now hundreds of miles from water.
                        This meant expensive civilian contracts with drayage companies
                        or even more expensive government owned wagon trains managed,
                        operated and maintained by large numbers of employed civilians,
                        paid at the prevailing wage - which out west was several
                        times higher than eastern wages. The expenses seemed never
                        to stop. Army wagon trains, using mules or oxen, needed regularly
                        spaced repair, water and feed depots. Water and feed points
                        were necessary at least a days journey apart and had to be
                        resupplied either by Army contract or supply trains. If local
                        farmers could not deliver forage, hay and grain, to given
                        points, then the Army had to buy it at one point and stock
                        the feeding points or it had to carry feed for the animals
                        which were pulling the freight Wagons. This often meant a
                        ratio of two forage wagons to every freight wagon. If a train
                        was outbound for a destination which could not supply livestock
                        feed for the return journey and grazing along the route was
                        minimal, then empty wagons (actually partially loaded wagons
                        for the animals pulling them had to be fed) would start back
                        for a depot point, to load up with forage to meet the homeward
                        bound wagon column. If timely contact was not effected, costly
                        government mules (or oxen) would die. And the feared auditors
                        in Washington, D.C. would want to know why.</div></td>

                        F. Beale.In fact, when Beale won the contract for a re-survey
                        and road development along the 35th Parallel, Secretary
                        of War John B. Floyd ordered Beale to take 25 camels to
                        California (and return with them) as part of the expedition.
                        Beale exploded in anger and in ink to the Secretary. He
                        protested mightily and insisted that Floyd was wrong to
                        order him to use the camels. Secretary Floyd stood firm:
                        he wanted to see what these expensive forage burners, lounging
                        about Camp Verde outside of San Antonio could do. Reluctantly
                        Beale, who had no choice, traveled to Camp Verde, Texas,
                        and picked up the 25 camels.</div></td>

                        in the far western territory. The camels, with males

                        could procreate, and produce young, strong, healthy camels.
                        The herd continued to grow, if slowly. There is a great
                        deal of nonsense written about the brutality of Army
                        camel herders to their charges. Camels were reputedly
                        shot dead, bludgeoned to death, or stabbed to death by
                        their herders or packers. The Army took a dim view of
                        herders or packers destroying government property. Camels
                        were expensive, and if a herder, camel packer, or soldier
                        had killed a camel, he would have paid for it by deductions
                        from his salary. An examination of the salaries of herders,
                        packers, and soldiers in government employment records
                        revealed no such incident. The death of each camel (those
                        few that died before 1864, when they were sold) is documented
                        in government quartermaster records in the National Archives.

                        1861, the Army at Fort Smith, Arkansas, was still trying
                        to get back 10 of the camels sent with Beale on the second

                        in March 1860, had not yet recovered from the hard usage
                        of Samuel Bishop, who had worked them to haul supplies
                        to Beale's road expedition, his ranch, and to merchants
                        in the civilian town of Fort Tejon from New San Pedro
                        and Los Angeles. The camels remained at the grazing camp
                        12 miles east of the fort under the care of two civilian
                        herders, and a small detachment of soldiers to protect
                        the herders, until September 1860.</div></td>

                          Hadji Alli (&quot;Hi Jolly&quot;), riding a camel
                        like a Pony Express rider, carrying dispatches for Fort

                          Yuma run; it was not tried. Then in late 1862 and again
                          in early 1863 there was a proposal, by Major Clarence
                          Bennett, to carry mail from San Pedro to Tucson, Arizona.
                          Nothing happened. An irregular mail express was attempted
                          from San Pedro to Camp Latham (Culver City) and from
                          Camp Latham on to Los Angeles. A few trips were made,
                          but then the service was dropped. Bennett then suggested
                          a mail run to newly re-opened Fort Mojave on the Colorado
                          River. The express was tried, but the camel foundered
                          and died 65 miles from Los Angeles and &quot;Hi-Jolly&quot; once
                          again carried the mail packet on his back across the
                          desert on foot to reach the fort on the far side of
                          the Colorado River.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          Major Bennett then proposed sending the camels to Fort
                          Mojave but Lieut. Williamson, the former acting assistant
                          at Camp Latham and Drum Barracks, rigorously protested
                          the move. He could barely feed his own mules, which
                          were necessary for the operation of the desert fort.
                          He had no extra forage to feed a small herd of camels.
                          Furthermore, the camels were unsuited for the rocky
                          desert roads of the Mojave. The camels' hooves were
                          too tender; they became lame and were useless. Williamson
                          declared that Edward Beale had learned this years ago,
                          but had not reported the truth about his use of camels
                          on the California desert floor.</p>

                          At this point Federal Surveyor-General Edward F. Beale
                          of California and Nevada, from his San Francisco office,
                          again appeared on the scene. He requested the use of
                          the camels in order to conduct land surveys of the
                          uninhabited portions of the new State of Nevada. Brigadier
                          General George Wright, then in command of the Department
                          of the Pacific, endorsed Beale's concept and Lieut.
                          Colonel Edwin B. Babbitt, the Department' s quartermaster,
                          pondered the suggestion and then agreed with Wright's
                          opinion. In reality, Babbitt felt the camels would
                          never be &quot;used
                          profitably&quot; and as early as November 1862, had
                          recommended that the experiment be cancelled and the
                          camels sold. However, Beale's request and the Army
                          decision to turn the camels over to another federal
                          agency were kicked upstairs to Washington, D.C. The
                          Quartermaster General in Washington endorsed Wright's
                          proposal and Wright was then about to take action when
                          two separate developments delayed his decision.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          In mid-July 1863, Captain William G. Morris, Assistant
                          Quartermaster at Wilmington, penned a letter to Colonel
                          Babbitt. Beale, Morris stated, only wanted part of
                          the herd and the camels from his experiments had developed
                          a personality problem. The camels did not like being
                          used in small groups away from the herd. They became
                          sulky when separated, refused to eat or drink, and
                          on reaching a stream of water a camel would suddenly
                          lie down in it, throwing the rider and refusing to
                          move. On rocky or gravelly roads their feet became
                          tender, and very sore. They became cranky and refused
                          to take commands and often upon nearing a creek dumped
                          their riders into the water.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          In the meantime, Beale was accused of misusing government
                          funds and of irregularities in conducting surveys.
                          It would appear that Beale was only surveying property
                          in which he, or his friends, had a financial interest.
                          The main charge was that Beale had spent a great deal
                          of his federal budget on redecorating his own office
                          in San Francisco. The amount of $64,000 spent on new
                          carpets and furnishings was bandied about in anti-Beale
                          circles. Beale was suddenly in disfavor and General
                          Wright withdrew his support.<br>
                          In early September 1863, the General in Washington,
                          D.C. wrote to Colonel Babbitt that the Department of
                          the Pacific should sell the camels. Babbitt requested
                          opinions from his quartermasters. Lieutenant Williamson
                          wrote that the camels were of no use. Again, he stated
                          the failures of their use at Camp Latham and at San
                          Pedro. And he reminded Babbbitt that the experiments
                          by &quot;Lieutenant
                          Beale and his partner Samuel Bishop&quot; showed that
                          mules were superior. The roads when rough and rocky crippled
                          the animals. They were only good on sandy ground. Williamson
                          reminded Babbitt that the recent trial run of a camel
                          to Fort Mojave had foundered the animal just 65 miles
                          from Los Angeles, and the mail carrier had to walk on
                          to Fort Mojave. The express mail could be carried by &quot;horses
                          or mules with regularity and with much less expense to
                          the government.&quot; Babbitt was convinced; the camels
                          would be sold at auction as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          A decision was made to sell the camels at auction at
                          Benicia Arsenal. Obviously too many people in the Los
                          Angeles area knew their weaknesses and there was an
                          import market for camels in the San Francisco area
                          where, after several false starts, a merchant had been
                          bringing in Siberian camels since 1860.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          Captain Morris was informed to prepare to send the
                          camels northward at the earliest moment, but at the
                          cheapest method. On November 19, 1863, Morris replied
                          to Babbitt that the camels, apparently 35 or 37 in
                          number, were &quot;in
                          first rate condition for the trip to Benicia Depot.&quot; However,
                          he was delayed in forwarding them due to the heavy
                          winter storms along the coast route. After two years
                          of terrible drought, it was raining. Morris also considered
                          that the current storms would produce grass along the
                          coastal road, allowing the animals to be fed cheaply
                          enroute. The camels were started north in late December
                          1863. For a brief period Morris thought of shipping
                          them by sea, but the cost of feeding them was unreasonable
                          and so Morris decided the final answer was to drive
                          them overland.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          The camels reached Santa Barbara on December 30, 1863
                          and the herders held them there while they celebrated
                          the coming of the New Year. Then they crossed the mountains
                          and moved on to the Salinas Valley and progressed to
                          Mission San Jose. They skirted the south end of the
                          bay and traveled up the east road of the shoreline
                          of the Contra Costa, arriving at the landing site for
                          Martinez on January 17, 18 64. The next day the camels
                          were ferried across the lower Carquinez Straits to
                          the government wharf at Benicia Arsenal and were then
                          moved to the corrals behind the stone constructed buildings
                          at the Benicia Quartermaster Depot. They were placed
                          in the open corrals; they were not stabled in any of
                          the fairly newly buildings at the depot.1</p>
                        <p><br>
                          Auction notices were published and on February 26,
                          1864, the gavel came down on each camel as a separate
                          government item. The high bidder for almost all the
                          camels was Samuel McLeneghan, who reputedly had worked
                          with the government camels earlier. However, nowhere
                          in government employment hiring records was McLeneghan's
                          name found. The 37 camels brought only $1,945, much
                          to the grief of the Benicia Depot's quartermaster for
                          be had expected more active bidding and a higher sales
                          profit. Apparently McLeneghan was the only bidder,
                          and the auctioneer had trouble getting any response
                          from the meager crowd that showed up. McLeneghan got
                          the whole herd for $52.56 each.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          The next day, the Benicia quartermaster wrote a report
                          to his senior in the Department of the Pacific headquarters
                          in San Francisco. He expressed his regrets that the
                          total amount of money was so low, explaining that few
                          of the people who attended were interested in putting
                          forth money for camels. He had hoped for more; the
                          auctioneer had tried mightily to encourage the group
                          of interested or curious spectators, but at least the
                          camels were sold. The experiment in California was
                          over. As consolation he offered a thought of relief: &quot;They
                          have been but a source of expense for years past.&quot;</p>
                        <p><br>
                          Author's Note: For years I have worked on the fascinating,
                          if disappointing, story of the camel experiment in
                          the West. I have plowed through clouds of myths and
                          good stories, and have been supported by the ongoing
                          humor of my colleagues in this business. My friends
                          have sent numerous new clues, or badly interpreted
                          or footnoted tales of the camels. But there is one
                          last tale. Humboldt Lagoons State Park has been one
                          of my history projects with the Department of Parks
                          and Recreation and the lagoons are located in Humboldt
                          County, far away from Fort Tejon, Drum Barracks and
                          Benicia Arsenal. Yet, the camels haunt me.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          In mid-1865, two camels of government vintage were
                          sold by McLeneghan, or his associates, to the Portland,
                          Oregon, Zoo. They were placed aboard the ocean going
                          steamer, the Brother Jonathan, in the same compartment
                          where George Wright's big black riding horse was also
                          stabled, and the ship steamed out of San Francisco
                          for the Columbia River. Off Crescent City the Brother
                          Jonathan struck a submerged rock and went down, with
                          only a few of the human passengers surviving. All the
                          animals aboard were lost. Several weeks later, on the
                          long sandbar which blocks Stone Lagoon from the ocean,
                          the bodies of General Wright's horse and a &quot;Fort Tejon camel&quot; washed
                          ashore. The local ranchers were forced to bury the
                          stinking carcasses. One just cannot get away from the
                          Army camels.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          The &quot;Camel Barns&quot; at Benicia Arsenal are
                          not camel barns. The elongated double tiered stone buildings
                          were &quot;construction buildings&quot; where the Quartermaster
                          Department manufactured equipment or altered civilian
                          items purchased on the open market prior to delivery
                          to the troops in the field. Later, the buildings were
                          used for storage as warehouses.</p>
