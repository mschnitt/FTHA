                    <p>When
                      earthquake scientists, or seismologists, think about great
                      earthquakes in California in historic times, three in particular
                      stand out. The most recent &quot;great&quot; earthquake
                      to strike California was also the most famous: the 1906 &quot; San
                      Francisco&quot; earthquake, which (along with the fires
                      that followed) destroyed much of San Francisco and was
                      felt over most of California. Only thirty-four years earlier,
                      in 1872, Owens Valley in eastern California was rocked
                      by an earthquake that was felt over good portions of both
                      California and Nevada. And the largest earthquake to hit
                      Southern California in historic times occurred on January
                      9th, 1857, and it came to be known as the great &quot; Fort
                      Tejon&quot; earthquake, although such appellation could
                      be very misleading.</p>

                    <p>Fort Tejon, in fact,
                      was not the epicenter, nor was it even near the epicenter
                      of the earthquake. Surface rupture originated northwest
                      of Parkfield in Monterey County and propagated southeastward
                      for over 360 km (225 miles) along the San Andreas Fault
                      to the Cajon Pass northwest of San Bernardino. Technically,
                      Parkfield was the epicenter of this earthquake, as it was
                      the origin of the rupture, but most scientists would be
                      more concerned with the extent and location of the entire
                      rupture; Fort Tejon was approximately the midway point
                      of the rupture. The earthquake actually acquired its name
                      because Fort Tejon was the only populated locality near
                      the fault, and naturally, the Fort suffered more damage
                      than the rest of sparsely-populated 1857 Southern California.</p>
                    <p>In comparison to the other &quot;great&quot; earthquakes
                      of historic times, the 1857 &quot;Fort Tejon&quot; earthquake
                      was significantly larger than the 1872 Owens Valley (estimated
                      magnitude 7.8) quake, and was equally as large as, if not
                      larger than, the 1906 &quot;San Francisco&quot; earthquake
                      (estimated magnitude 7.9-8.0). Estimates for &quot; Fort
                      Tejon&quot; are also in the vicinity of magnitude 8.0.
                      The 1857 and 1906 events were both on the San Andreas Fault,
                      although the 1906 earthquake ruptured the northern segment
                      of the fault, from Hollister (San Benito Co.) northward,
                      for 400 km (250 miles). Duration of shaking, along the
                      fault, for both 1857 and 1906 is estimated to be as long
                      as two minutes.</p>
                    <p><br>
                      In areas away from the fault, such as Los Angeles, San
                      Bernardino, and Santa Barbara, damage from 1857 was surprisingly
                      light, although it is unclear how modern high-rises would
                      respond to the long-period motion experienced at significant
                      distances from large earthquakes; high-rises may be more
                      susceptible to long-period ground motion than low buildings.
                      Fort Tejon, on the other hand, suffered considerable damage
                      from the mainshock, and it was battered by aftershocks
                      for months and years to come -- both a direct consequence
                      of the Fort's proximity to the fault. Two large aftershocks
                      (approximate magnitudes 6.0-6.5) occurred within a week
                      following the mainshock, which were felt over much of Southern
                      California, although aftershocks were still being felt
                      on a weekly basis at Fort Tejon over a year later. And
                      it is expected that if any other locations along or near
                      the fault (i.e., Wrightwood, Palmdale, Frazier Park, or
                      Taft) were populated back then, those locations would have
                      reported similar intensities during the mainshock to those
                      at Fort Tejon, and those locations could have experienced
                      just as many aftershocks.</p>
                    <p><br>
                      The 1857 quake was the last so-called &quot;Big One&quot; in
                      Southern California, and a similar event will almost certainly
                      happen again in the future. Questions remain, however,
                      as to when it will occur, and whether the next &quot;Big
                      One&quot; will be as big as 1857. Los Angeles appears to
                      have fared well last time, but it remains unclear how modern
                      structures will respond in the future. It turns out that
                      for Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and Santa Barbara, blind
                      thrust faults and other local faults are a bigger risk
                      than the San Andreas Fault, simply because the former are
                      closer to the population centers and because we know less
                      about them, but for Fort Tejon, Palmdale, and other cities
                      along the San Andreas, the San Andreas remains the biggest
                      threat. Only by continued monitoring and research can we
                      hope to understand and reduce the seismic hazard over all
                      of Southern California. We can never prevent earthquakes,
                      but by knowing what may happen, we can prepare for them.</p>

  &quot;EARTHQUAKES. &mdash; It appears that old mother earth is
                still troubled with the consequences of her great convulsion
                of the 9th of January last. She has not yet recovered her quiet and
                steady habits, but exhibits the weakness of her internals by
                shakes, of almost nightly occurrence. Fort Tejon, seems to be the region
                where her disease is located, for the good people of that Post,
                are almost nightly entertained with earthquake shocks. Last week,
                one or two very severe shocks occurred there, which awoke the
                sleepers and sent them in a hurry to breathe the fresh air of the parade
                ground....&quot;</p>
