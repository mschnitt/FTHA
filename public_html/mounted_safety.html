                          A - General Rules and Regulations<br>
                          1. The authenticity, style, and type of horse equipment
                          used will be the decision of each Company Commander
                          and his Unit. The condition and serviceability of such
                          equipment will be under the jurisdiction of the Mounted
                          Safety Officer, who will be known as the &quot;Chief of Mounts&quot;,
                          or his designee.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          2. Each Company Commander, or senior Company member,
                            will perform an equipment safety check on each mounted
                            member of his Unit prior to 10:00 AM, Sunday morning,
                            on Ft. Tejon CWP weekends.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          3. The Company Commander, or senior Company member,
                          will perform the same inspection prior to any activity
                          at which his Unit will participate mounted. (i.e. parades,
                          back countries, displays, etc.)</p>
                        <p><br>
                          4. The purpose of the inspection will be to insure
                          that each horse is properly saddled and that all tack
                          is in serviceable condition and properly adjusted,
                          and that both horse and rider are ready and capable
                          of safely participating in the planned activity.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          5. Unserviceable or questionable equipment will be
                          repaired or replaced before the person is allowed to
                          take part in the event.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          6. The Mounted Safety officer will confer with the
                          Unit Commander(s) concerning any problems and will
                          conduct inspections and spot checks as he feels appropriate.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          7. Any disagreement will be settled by the CWP Director,
                          however, the Safety Officer's decision will stand until
                          the situation has been corrected or his decision over-turned
                          by the CWP Director.<br>
                          8. Each mounted cavalryman and his horse will be considered
                          a team. Both, together, must take and pass a mounted
                          safety course before taking part in any FTHA CWP event.
                          The mounted safety course must be taken each year at
                          a minimum, and the rider certified on his membership
                          card by the Chief of Mounts.</p>

                          events. With written approval from the FTHA Board of
                          Directors, rental horses may be used at backcountries,
                          encampments, and re-enactments.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          10. Mounted Units will leave/not take the field (at
                          Ft. Tejon) once the dismounted troops have been deployed.
                          A single mounted courier may be used behind the lines.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          11. Mounted troops will maintain a minimum safety distance
                          of thirty (30) feet from the spectators/safety ropes/other
                          Units.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          12. Any member who owns more than one horse may loan
                          their extra horse(s) to another member, however, both
                          the horse and rider must pass the mounted safety course
                          together.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          13. An FTHA CWP Mounted Safety Card will be maintained
                          by the Chief of Mounts for each horse and rider, as
                          a team. Any change in the composition of that team
                          will require a new test and card, showing the make-up
                          of the new team.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          14. Mounted safety infractions will be noted on the
                          back of the Mounted Safety Card. Three (3) infractions,
                          within one (1) year of issue date, will cause the team
                          to be denied access to further events until their training
                          has been reviewed with the rider, Company Commander,
                          Chief of Mounts and the CWP Director.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          15. Any serious safety infraction will require the
                          immediate removal of the mounted team from the event.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          16. A serious mounted safety infraction may be noted
                          by anyone, mounted or on foot, and a &quot;Cease Fire&quot; called
                          if necessary.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          17. Anyone found drinking alcohol after 10:00 PM on
                          Saturday night of a Ft. Tejon weekend will not be allowed
                          on the field mounted on Sunday. Anyone found to be
                          under the influence of drugs or alcohol on Sunday morning
                          will be refused access to the event.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
                          Section B - Inspections<br>
                          1. Safety inspections will be looking for, but not
                          limited to, the following:<br>
                          a) Worn or damaged leather<br>
                          b) Dryrot, cracked or split leather<br>
                          c) New leather which has not been properly oiled before
                          use<br>
                          d) Old leather which has not been kept properly oiled<br>
                          e) Worn cinches<br>
                          f) Particular attention will be given to stirrup, girth,
                          and quarter straps<br>
                          g) Although not mandatory, it is strongly recommended
                          that every man use a sursingle when mounted at any
                          event.<br>
                          h) Bridles and halters in good serviceable condition<br>
                          i) A lead strap or rope attached to the halter and
                          the free end tied around the horse's neck or to the
                          left front saddle ring</p>
                        <p><br>
                          2. Horses<br>
                          a) Each horse will be inspected for soundness or obvious
                          sickness and<br>
                          injury. Horses with open cuts, bad feet (including
                          overdue trimming or<br>
                          shoeing), saddle sores or infections may be removed
                          from the picket line<br>
                          and denied use in the event. Whenever possible, these
                          problems will be<br>
                          corrected and the horse returned to service.<br>
                          b) Horses will be kept on Company (or larger) picket
                          lines when not in use.<br>
                          The Company(s) will provide a picket line guard(s)
                          during the hours of<br>
                          darkness or when necessary to keep the public from
                          entering the picket<br>
                          line during the daytime. Any horse that cannot get
                          along with the rest<br>
                          of the herd will be removed from the picket line and
                          his owner will be<br>
                          responsible for his security at an alternate site.<br>
                          c) Only geldings and mares will be used<br>
                          d) To prepare any horse for the unusual situations
                          that are found at a<br>
                          typical FM function, it is suggested that each rider/unit
                          train<br>
                          their horse(s) using &quot;Cooke's Cavalry Tactics&quot;,
                          ca. 1862, Article VII.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
                          Section C - Cavalry Weapons<br>
                          The mounted troops are bound by the same rules and
                          safety standards in regard to weapon safety as the
                          rest of the FTHA CWP. The following rules are in addition
                          to the current FTHA CWP safety rules. These rules are
                          in effect when mounted.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          1. Pistol<br>
                          a) The pistol will be drawn only upon command of the
                          Unit Commander.<br>
                          b) When fired to the front while mounted, the muzzle
                          will be elevated above the horse's head so as not to
                          cause harm to the horse or his hearing.<br>
                          c) Pistols may be fired to the flanks and rear in a
                          more realistic/aimed manner; so long as safe distances
                          still prevail. The horse covers distance much faster
                          than a person on foot. Therefore, great care must be
                          exercised to insure that an action started at a safe
                          distance still exists before weapons are fired.<br>
                          d) Once the pistol is drawn, from the holster, it will
                          be held in the raised/ready position, muzzle up and
                          right hand at shoulder level, until just before firing.<br>
                          e) The hammer will not be cocked until the pistol is
                          brought to bear and fixed. Pistols may not be re-loaded
                          while mounted.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          2. Carbine<br>
                          a) The carbine will be kept on the saddle and not attached
                          to the carbine<br>
                          sling while mounted during battles. Mounted troops
                          may use a device of<br>
                          their choosing to secure the carbine to the saddle,
                          but all methods<br>
                          must be approved by the Chief of Mounts. Several suggestions
                          are:<br>
                          1) The use of a carbine boot that supports the carbine
                          completely.<br>
                          2) A metal snap link or hook that would connect the
                          carbine slide<br>
                          ring with the saddle, and used in conjunction with
                          the carbine<br>
                          thimble,<br>
                          NOTE: Tie down affairs using leather thongs or cords
                          will not be<br>
                          acceptable.<br>
                          3) These boots or link/hooks should be removed for
                          living history<br>
                          displays and demonstrations. At these times, the carbine
                          may be<br>
                          attached to the carbine sling.<br>
                          b) Once drawn from the thimble or boot, the carbine
                          will be kept pointing muzzle up, with the butt resting
                          on the right leg, until ready to fire. The same precautions
                          exist as were noted with the pistol.<br>
                          c) When re-loading, the carbine will be held in the
                          left hand at the fore stock, muzzle pointing slightly
                          forward and downward.<br>
                          d) The hammer will be placed in the half-cock position
                          during loading and until ready to fire.<br>
                          e) Should the carbine be returned to the boot/thimble
                          while loaded, the primer will be removed before the
                          carbine is returned.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          3. Sabre<br>
                          a) The sabre may be worn on the field while mounted
                          and during battles.<br>
                          b) The sabre may not be withdrawn from the scabbard
                          for any reason during battles. To do so will require
                          an immediate &quot;Cease
                          Fire&quot; to be called and the offending party removed
                          from the field.<br>
                          c) The sabre may be used for public displays and pre-planned
                          programs. These programs must be pre-planned, well
                          rehearsed by the actual performers, and reviewed and
                          approved by the Chief of Mounts and the CWP Director.<br>
                          d) Cuts, slashes, parries, etc., may be shown using
                          a combination of mounted and foot assistants, as long
                          as both the demonstrator and assistant are stationary.<br>
                          e) If for any reason the horse becomes jumpy or hard
                          to handle, the demonstration will be stopped until
                          a substitute is brought in, or the program will proceed
                          to the next event.</p>
