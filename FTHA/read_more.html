                                    and the rest of the Pacific and Southwest
                                    played an important and largely ignored role
                                    in securing the region for the Union during
                                    the Civil War. When discussing the War in
                                    the Pacific, I often encounter the opinion
                                    that &quot;nothing happened
                                    in the Pacific States.&quot; I've even been
                                    told, &quot;The Civil War in California?! California
                                    wasn't even a state!&quot; Wrong! Since statehood
                                    (September 9, 1850), Californians had formed
                                    many a volunteer and militia company, mostly
                                    in the northern part of the State to combat
                                    a perceived Indian threat. These militia units,
                                    along with the Regular Army, helped to form
                                    a sense of order and authority in a new state
                                    with a rapidly expanding citizenry resulting
                                    from the &quot;Gold Rush.&quot;</p>
                                  <p class="style12">In Lincoln's initial call for 75,000 volunteers
                                    to quell the secessionist uprising in the
                                    South, the State of California was not asked
                                    to supply any troops. But by July 24, 1861,
                                    California was asked to provide one regiment
                                    of infantry and five companies of cavalry
                                    to guard the overland mail. A second request
                                    for California volunteers was sent on August
                                    14, 1861. This request was responsible for
                                    the 2nd through 5th Infantry, and the 2nd
                                    Cavalry Regiments. In 1863, and again in
                                    1864, further calls produced three more infantry
                                    regiments, and a battalion of native (Californios)
                                    cavalry from the Santa Barbara and Los Angeles
                                    areas. All total, California provided 17,500
                                    troops for the Union, more troops per capita
                                    than any other state.</p>
                                  <p class="style12">Early in the war, California
                                    Volunteers in Federal service helped to take
                                    over responsibilities from the Regular Army
                                    that was being recalled to the East. Californians
                                    served along the entire western coast from
                                    Washington Territory to the Mexican state
                                    of Sonora, and campaigned as far east as
                                    Utah and Texas and throughout New Mexico
                                    and Arizona Territories. The Californians
                                    primary enemy was the Indian and the environment.
                                    They did meet and close with Confederate
                                    troops in the Southwest as part of the &quot;California
                                    Column.&quot; The California Volunteers served
                                    their country from July, 1861 to January,
                                    1867, when the last troops were mustered
                                    out of service.</p>

                                      2nd California Volunteer Infantry was formed.
                                      Colonel Francis J. Lippitt was appointed
                                      as commander of the regiment. Lippitt had
                                      been a member of Stevenson's 1st New York
                                      Volunteers that came to California in 1846
                                      to help wrest California away from Mexico
                                      in the Mexican-American War.</p>

                                      The 2nd Regiment was first organized at
                                        the Presidio in San Francisco. After
                                        completing its organization, five companies
                                        were sent to Northern California, Oregon
                                        and Washington Territory to relieve Regular
                                        troops, while two companies were sent
                                        to Santa Barbara. Most of the companies
                                        were organized from San Francisco, Cal.
                                        and Carson City, Nev., with the earliest
                                        enlistments having been made on September
                                        2, 1861.</p>

                                      Company G was first organized on September
                                      21, 1861, at a meeting held in the theater
                                      at Angels Camp, Cal., by Captain William
                                      W. Stuart. On October 9, 1861, the company
                                      arrived in San Francisco where more men
                                        joined, the company being officially
                                        mustered into service on November 29,
                                        1861. Company G spent the next month
                                        in camp at Camp Sumner at the Presidio,
                                        moving to Alcatraz Island on December
                                        20, 1861. On March 8, 1862, Company G
                                        set sail for Crescent City on board the
                                      steamer Oregon. Upon reaching Crescent
                                        City, the company marched to Fort Ter-Waw
                                        and then to Camp Lincoln where it would
                                        remain until being ordered to report
                                        to Benicia [near San Francisco] on June
                                        16, 1863.</p>

                                      At Benicia, Company G traded its old M/1816
                                      converted smoothbores for new M1855/1861
                                      Springfield rifles. The company remained
                                      at Benicia for two months until it received
                                      orders to march southward through the San
                                      Joaquin Valley to Camp Babbitt in Visalia,
                                      on August 12, 1863. On its march south,
                                      the company passed through Camp Stanford
                                      and Fort Miller, now under Lake Millerton
                                      near Fresno.</p>

                                      Company G reached Camp Babbitt on August
                                      28, 1863, where it was garrisoned for just
                                      over three months, and then was ordered
                                      to Fort Tejon, arriving there on January
                                      16, 1864, one day after Company B.</p>

                                      Company B was first mustered into United
                                      States service on September 5, 1861 in
                                      San Francisco, Cal. The company remained
                                      in San Francisco only a short time before
                                      being shipped to Washington Territory on
                                      September 17, 1861. In Washington Territory,
                                      the company concerned itself with Indian
                                      trouble until July 31, 1862 when it arrived
                                      back in San Francisco. The company was
                                      sent to Alcatraz Island for only 3 days
                                      before being sent to Fort Humbolt in Northern
                                      California on August 3, 1862.<br>
                                      Company B was engaged in chasing after
                                      Indians in Klamath and Humbolt counties
                                      for almost a year. Their scouting missions
                                      took them through the most rugged of terrain
                                      and the company was employed in hacking
                                      out a 15 mile road through this wilderness.
                                      On June 15, 1863 the company sailed on
                                      the steamer Panama for Benicia, where the
                                      company was rearmed and refitted before
                                      marching for Fort Miller in route to Fort
                                      Tejon. The company marched 60 miles from
                                      Fort Miller to Camp Babbitt in only two
                                      days, arriving at the latter on December
                                      30, 1863. Company B finally arrived at
                                      Fort Tejon on January 15, 1864 after marching
                                      140 miles in six days.</p>

                                      Tejon was founded in 1854 on Grapevine
                                      Creek, 17 miles from its originally intended
                                      location on Tejon Creek. Maj. Donaldson
                                      of the 1st U.S. Dragoons selected the site
                                      for the new Fort at its present location
                                      because of the ready availability of water,
                                      fuel and forage. Originally called Camp
                                      Canada de las Uvas for the wild grapes
                                      in the area, it was officially christened
                                      Fort Tejon, (Tejon meaning Badger in Spanish),
                                      over the objection of Brevet Lt. Col. Benjamin
                                      L. Beall, 1st Dragoons, who suggested &quot;Fort

                                      been killed by a bear there.</p>

                                      The primary purpose of the garrison at
                                        Fort Tejon was to protect and control
                                        the Indians on the Sebastian Indian Reservation,
                                        and to control the major north-south
                                        road through Grapevine Canyon. Fort Tejon
                                        was garrisoned by various companies of
                                        the 1st Dragoons, and briefly from late
                                        1857 to 1858 by a detachment of the 3rd
                                        Artillery, serving as infantry. In December,
                                        1856, the regimental headquarters of
                                        the 1st Dragoons was moved from Fort
                                        Union, New Mexico Terr., to Fort Tejon,
                                        where it remained until the post was
                                        abandoned on June 15, 186 1.</p>

                                      The rapidly expanding war in the eastern
                                      United States forced the government to
                                      recall the Army to the new seat of hostilities
                                      as fast as possible. This need for troops
                                      back in the East along with a growing fear
                                      of prosecessionist activities in the Los
                                      Angeles and San Bernardino areas, ultimately

                                      discussed above, much of the Californians'
                                      time was concerned with battling the so-called
                                      Indian menace. In 1863, it was deemed necessary
                                      to reoccupy Fort Tejon. On July 24, 1863,
                                      Fort Tejon was regarrisoned by Companies
                                      D and G of the 2nd California Cavalry under
                                      the command of Capt. James M. Ropes.</p>

                                      The 2nd Cavalry reactivated Fort Tejon
                                      with approximately 300 Paiute Indians camping
                                      near the Post. When the Paiutes were forcibly
                                      marched from the Owens Valley by the 2nd
                                      Cav., they numbered 1000, a third of them
                                      being sent to Fort Tejon. The Indians were
                                      kept in a camp down Grapevine Canyon from
                                      the Fort called the &quot;Pot Holes.&quot; After
                                      the arrival of the 2nd Infantry, the garrison
                                      provided the Paiutes with a meager ration
                                      to keep them in place and to keep them from
                                      starving [which the Volunteers were not supposed
                                      to do; Capt. Schmidt satisfied headquarters
                                      by deeming the rations for &quot;Prisoners
                                      of War&quot;.]<br>
                                      The government Indian Bureau agents refused

                                      As the two Infantry companies settled into
                                      their new home, their time was occupied
                                      at repairing and maintaining the Fort's
                                      buildings that had fallen into disrepair
                                      during the two years that the post had
                                      been abandoned. There were frequent patrols
                                      mounted from the Fort to keep track of
                                      unruly whites and to maintain control over
                                      the Paiutes encamped nearby. There were
                                      always duties to perform in the garrison
                                      relating to the maintenance of the Fort.
                                      There was wood to be hauled and cut, rations
                                      to be prepared, inspections and endless
                                      drills on the parade ground. In short,
                                      Army life.</p>

                                      Life at Fort Tejon was dismal to say the
                                      least. 1st. Sgt. Curtis Greenleaf, Co.
                                      G, complained in his journal that Fort
                                      Tejon was worthless because the local town
                                      was devoid of a whorehouse. Of some intrigue,
                                      however, Pvt. James Anderson of Co. B,
                                      was murdered one evening while returning
                                      from a night out in town. The investigation
                                      turned up one James Conrad, Co. G, as a
                                      suspect, but the subsequent court martial
                                      could not confirm guilt.</p>

                                      Company G left Fort Tejon on June 4, 1864
                                      for Drum Barracks in Wilmington. Fort Tejon
                                      would finally be closed when Company B
                                      left the post on September 11, 1864, ending
                                      the last period of military occupation
                                      of the Post, lasting from 1854 to 1864.</p>
